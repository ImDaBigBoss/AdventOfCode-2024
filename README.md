# Advent of Code - 2024

This is my - probably terrible - code used to participate in Advent of Code this year.

## The code doesn't work?

Well that isn't strictly true, I just can't post my inputs here:
> **Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?** Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, _please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or **your inputs**_. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.
